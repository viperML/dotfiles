​​​Dear Luigi,

I am Fernando, I work at Inria Grenoble with Bruno Raffin and Pierre Neyron, in the NumPEx project, specificaly on the packaging and CI work-package.

BigDFT is part of a list of software that we are looking at (List here https://cloud.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/s/MT2b8RD78MZJdkj).

Our goal regarding that software list, is to facilitate its deployment on computation centers (espacially at TGCC and CINES), specially by working on their packaging in solution such as Guix and Spack.

So I'm contacting you because I saw that you are one of the developers of BigDFT.

We have several questions:
- Spack
    - We saw that BigDFT is available in Spack. Is it satisfactory, well maintained?
    - Do you know if the spack packages are actually used? (the BigDFT installation documentation does not mention spack)
- Do you know of any existing work regarding the packaging of BigDFT in Guix ? (https://hpc.guix.info/)
- Is there any other topic we could help with the deployment or packaging of the software?

Best regards,
Fernando AYATS
