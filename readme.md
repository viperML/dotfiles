# ðŸ—’ About

These are my personal configuration files for my Linux and Windows machines. Feel free to grab anything that you find interesting.

## Layout

These Nix dotfiles don't use flakes, but rather classical Nix. The main folders are the following:

- `./npins`: generated by [npins](https://github.com/andir/npins), tracks nixpkgs and other external project. I'm not the biggest
  fan of its UX though.
- `./packages`: loads nixpkgs, and threads multiple overlays to create my package set, from `./packages/<name>` and from
  `./modules/wrapper-manager`: can be called directly with `pkgs = import ./packages` or with `nix-build -A <name> packages`.
- `./hosts/<name>`: entrypoints for each PC I use. You can build these with `nixos-rebuild <cmd> --file ./hosts/<name>` or
  with `nh os <cmd> --file ./hosts/<name>`.
- `./modules/nixos`: modules for shared functionality, more or less by topic. They don't expose any option to `.enable` but
  rather are simply added to `imports`.
- `./modules/maid`: [nix-maid](https://github.com/viperML/nix-maid) modules, my own home-manager alternative.
- `./modules/wrapper-manager`: [wrapper-manager](https://github.com/viperML/wrapper-manager) modules, used to configure app
  with wrappers.
